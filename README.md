Primer on different forecasting techniques


### Data
Recursive forecasting involves iteratively predicting future values based on previously observed values. It is a powerful technique used in time series analysis to make predictions beyond the available data. By using a clean and reliable time series dataset, we can ensure accurate and meaningful forecasts.

The starter time series dataset provided at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/time-series-practice-dataset) is a great resource to get started with forecasting. It contains well-organized and preprocessed data, making it suitable for practicing different forecasting techniques. You can explore the dataset, analyze its patterns, and apply various forecasting models to make predictions.

Remember, recursive forecasting requires careful consideration of factors such as seasonality, trend, and any underlying patterns in the data. It is important to preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and choose appropriate forecasting models to achieve accurate results.

So, grab the starter time series dataset, dive into the world of recursive forecasting, and enjoy exploring the fascinating field of time series analysis. Happy forecasting!
