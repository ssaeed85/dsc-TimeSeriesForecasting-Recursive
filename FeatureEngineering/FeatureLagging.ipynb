    "In the realm of time series forecasting, lagged features play a pivotal role by incorporating values from preceding time steps as inputs to forecast future observations. The fundamental premise of time series analysis is the assumption that historical observations exert influence on forthcoming events.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating lag features, models can capture temporal dependencies and patterns, such as seasonality and trends, inherent in the data. For instance, the sales figure of the previous month can be a strong indicator of the sales figure in the current month. Utilizing lagged features allows forecasting models to leverage this historical data, improving the accuracy and robustness of predictions. In essence, lag features bridge the gap between past events and future predictions, making them indispensable in time series forecasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The utilization of lagged features, even in simple forecasting models, can yield surprisingly robust results by capitalizing on the temporal structure of the data."
